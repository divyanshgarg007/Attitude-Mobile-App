#1 add font file in 
PROJECT-DIRECTORY/assets/fonts

#2
Add the configuration to the project
If not already created, create a config file at the root of the project named react-native.config.js. Proceed by adding the following code inside module.exports:

module.exports = {
    project: {
        ios:{},
        android:{}
    },
    assets:['./assets/fonts/'],
}

#3
Link the assets to the project

After the above steps have been done, we can simply run a command to link the fonts that we just added.

$ npx react-native link
